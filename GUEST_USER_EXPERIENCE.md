# Guest User Experience Update

## Overview
Implemented dedicated guest user views for Profile and Booking sections to provide a better experience for users who haven't logged in yet. Instead of immediately redirecting to login, users can now see what features are available and why they should create an account.

## Changes Made

### 1. AuthController
- **New File**: `lib/app/controllers/auth_controller.dart`
- **Purpose**: Centralized authentication state management
- **Features**:
  - Real-time authentication state monitoring
  - Observable login status (`isLoggedIn`)
  - Current user data access
  - Sign out functionality

### 2. Guest Profile View
- **New File**: `lib/app/modules/profile/views/widgets/guest_profile_view.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Welcome message with app branding
  - Benefits of creating an account
  - Clean, modern design with blue theme
  - Sign In and Create Account buttons
  - App information at bottom

### 3. Guest Booking View
- **New File**: `lib/app/modules/booking/views/widgets/guest_booking_view.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Service preview cards with prices
  - Benefits of signing in to book
  - Call-to-action buttons for login/register
  - Option to browse gallery without login

### 4. Updated Profile View
- **Modified**: `lib/app/modules/profile/views/profile_view.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Uses `AuthController` for state management
  - Conditionally shows guest view or logged-in view
  - Removed redundant authentication checks

### 5. Updated Booking View
- **Modified**: `lib/app/modules/booking/views/booking_view.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Uses `AuthController` for state management
  - Shows guest booking view for non-logged users
  - Maintains full functionality for logged-in users

### 6. Updated ProfileController
- **Modified**: `lib/app/modules/profile/controllers/profile_controller.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated with `AuthController`
  - Simplified authentication state checks

### 7. Updated Bindings
- **Modified**: `lib/app/modules/bottom_navigation_bar/bindings/bottom_navigation_bar_binding.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `AuthController` to dependency injection

## User Experience Flow

### For Guest Users:
1. **Profile Tab**: Shows welcome screen with benefits and sign-in options
2. **Booking Tab**: Shows service preview and encourages account creation
3. **Gallery Tab**: Still accessible without login (unchanged)
4. **Home Tab**: Still accessible without login (unchanged)
5. **Transaction Tab**: Would need similar treatment (future enhancement)

### For Logged-in Users:
- All functionality remains the same
- Full access to profile management
- Complete booking flow
- Transaction history access

## Design Principles
- **Consistent Theme**: Maintains the blue-themed, modern design
- **Clear Call-to-Action**: Prominent sign-in and register buttons
- **Informative**: Shows users what they're missing without being pushy
- **Professional**: Clean, gradient-based design that matches the app's aesthetic

## Benefits
1. **Better UX**: Users can explore the app without being forced to login
2. **Higher Conversion**: Users understand the value before signing up
3. **Professional Appearance**: App looks complete even for guest users
4. **Reduced Friction**: Gallery and home remain accessible to everyone

## Technical Implementation
- Uses GetX reactive state management
- AuthController listens to Firebase auth state changes
- Conditional rendering based on authentication status
- Consistent navigation flow maintained

## Future Enhancements
1. Add guest view for Transaction tab
2. Implement "Browse Gallery" functionality in guest booking view
3. Add more detailed service information for guests
4. Consider allowing limited booking for guests with phone verification
